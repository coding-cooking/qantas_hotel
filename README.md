This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

## Things can be improved

1. Responsive UI.
2. Loading, but after changing to server side fetching data, it's faster than client side fetching data.
3. Avoid props drilling, using context or other state management tools when necessary.
